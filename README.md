# Learning Rust Overview

I recently wrote a Rust project to compute Fibonacci numbers and used memoization for efficiency. I've been seeing a lot of Rust content in my YouTube feed and wanted to understand what people were saying. This project helped me learn some of the key differences between Rust and C++, like Rust's strict ownership model and its powerful pattern matching. It was a great way to deepen my understanding of Rust and see how it compares to C++.

# Development Environment

I used Rust's standard libraries for a HashMap and command line arguments in my Fibonacci project. I also used Cargo and while I didn't need Cargo for this small project, it would be necessary in a larger one for managing dependencies and building the project.

# Useful Youtube Channels

- [Tech with Tim Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_KrYLW4jw8&list=PLbqMcQhGwVS1kssin2vOrzK3pPD7e-eeX&index=8) His content was short and to the point and the set up instructions were clear.
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) They have the most tutorials and teach everything under the sun, I would go back and watch their stuff when I think I'm confident in Rust and learn new things to implement.
- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) Short form summary content for super surface level information.
- [Web Site Name](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) Longer form Rust news and explaination but less of a tutorial channel.

# Future Work

- I plan on learning more of the differences between Rust and C++ to deepen my understanding of both languages and their unique features.
- I want to explore lower-level programming in Rust by using the unsafe keyword to better understand how it handles memory management and system programming.
- Ultimately, I aim to build a useful project in Rust, applying my new knowledge to create something practical.
